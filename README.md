## Usage

### Initialize the client

                              password: "bar",
                              host: "api.test.datacite.org")
```

### Create a Draft DOI

result = client.register_doi(prefix: '10.0001', suffix: 'bc123df4567')

result.either(
  -> response { response.doi },
  -> response { raise("Something went wrong", response.status) }
)
```

#### Auto-generated DOI's

```ruby
result = client.autogenerate_doi(prefix: '10.0001')

result.either(
  -> response { response.doi },
  -> response { raise("Something went wrong", response.status) }
)
```

### Update DOI's

```ruby
# See https://support.datacite.org/reference/dois-2#put_dois-id for the attributes
attributes = {
  relatedIdentifiers: [
    {

      relatedIdentifierType: "DOI",
      relationType: "References",

  -> response { raise("Something went wrong", response.status) }
)
```

### Validation
This gem validates using a json schema from https://github.com/datacite/schema/blob/master/source/json/kernel-4.3/datacite_4.3_schema.json

We've made the following changes:
  * relax the required fields (https://github.com/datacite/schema/issues/97)
  * add event property (https://github.com/datacite/schema/issues/100)
  * add url property (https://github.com/datacite/schema/issues/101)
  * add xml property to support Datacite 4.4 xml schema via the api (https://github.com/datacite/schema/issues/99)

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
